Here is an example of how you might implement an SVM in Julia for classification tasks:

using LIBSVM

# define the model
model = LIBSVM.SVM(SVC(), LinearKernel())

# train the model on the training data
LIBSVM.fit!(model, train_X, train_y)

# use the trained model to make predictions on the test data
predictions = LIBSVM.predict(model, test_X)

# evaluate the model's performance
accuracy = mean(test_y .== predictions)

Note that this is just one way to implement an SVM in Julia, and there are many other packages and approaches you can use. This example uses the LIBSVM package, which provides a convenient interface for working with SVMs in Julia.
