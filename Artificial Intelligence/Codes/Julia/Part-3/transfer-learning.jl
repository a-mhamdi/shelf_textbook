#= Transfer Learning =#

# Here's some example Julia code that demonstrates how to do transfer learning using the Flux.jl library:

using Flux
using Flux.Data.MNIST
using Flux: onehotbatch, onecold
using Base.Iterators: repeated, partition

# Load the pre-trained model
model = ResNet18()

# Replace the final layer
model.layers[end] = Dense(10)

# Freeze the weights of the pre-trained layers
for layer in model.layers[1:end-1]
    freeze!(layer)
end

# Load the MNIST dataset
X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = MNIST.load()

# Split the dataset into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val = partition(X_train, 0.8)
y_train, y_val = partition(y_train, 0.8)

# Convert the labels to one-hot encoding
y_train = onehotbatch(y_train, 0:9)
y_val = onehotbatch(y_val, 0:9)

# Define a loss function and an optimizer
loss_fn = Flux.crossentropy
opt = Flux.ADAM()

# Fine-tune the model
for epoch in 1:10
    for (x, y) in zip(X_train, y_train)
        # Compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the model's parameters
        gs = gradient(params(model)) do
            y_pred = model(x)
            loss_fn(y_pred, y)
        end

        # Update the model's parameters using the optimizer
        Flux.update!(opt, params(model), gs)
    end

    # Calculate the accuracy on the validation set
    accuracy = sum(onecold(model(X_val)) .== onecold(y_val)) / length(y_val)

    println("Epoch: $epoch, Accuracy: $accuracy")
end

# Test the model on the test set
accuracy = sum(onecold(model(X_test)) .== onecold(y_test)) / length(y_test)
println("Test accuracy: $accuracy")
