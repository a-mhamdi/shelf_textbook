#= CNN =#

# Here is a simple example of how a CNN could be implemented in Julia using the Flux.jl library:

using Flux

# define the CNN
function cnn(x)
    # the input x is a batch of images with dimensions (batch_size, height, width, channels)
    # define the convolutional layers
    c1 = Conv((3, 3), 3=>8, pad=(1, 1))(x)
    c2 = Conv((3, 3), 8=>16, pad=(1, 1))(c1)
    # define the pooling layers
    p1 = MaxPool((2, 2))(c2)
    p2 = MaxPool((2, 2))(p1)
    # flatten the output of the pooling layers
    f = flatten(p2)
    # define the fully connected layers
    fc1 = Dense(128, 32)(f)
    fc2 = Dense(32, 10)(fc1)
    # return the output of the fully connected layers
    return fc2
end

# define the loss function
loss(ŷ, y) = Flux.mse(ŷ, y)

# define the accuracy metric
accuracy(ŷ, y) = mean(Flux.argmax(ŷ) .== Flux.argmax(y))

# train the CNN
for (x, y) in data
    # pass the input data through the CNN to get the prediction
    ŷ = cnn(x)
    # compute the loss
    l = loss(ŷ, y)
    # update the network weights using gradient descent
    Flux.back!(l)
    # compute the accuracy
    a = accuracy(ŷ, y)
    # print the loss and accuracy
    println("Loss: $(l), Accuracy: $(a)")
end


# This is just a rough example, and there are many details that have been left out (such as how to load and preprocess the data, how to use a validation set to evaluate the model, etc.). However, this should give you an idea of how a CNN can be implemented in Julia using the Flux.jl library.
