#= GAN =#

# Here is a simple example of how a GAN could be implemented in Julia:

# define the generator network
function generator(z)
    # z is the input noise
    # the generator network should return a synthetic sample
    # for example, using a fully connected network:
    h = relu(z * W1 + b1)
    synthetic_sample = h * W2 + b2
    return synthetic_sample
end

# define the discriminator network
function discriminator(x)
    # x is the input data (either real or synthetic)
    # the discriminator network should return a score indicating the probability that the input is real
    # for example, using a fully connected network:
    h = relu(x * W3 + b3)
    score = h * W4 + b4
    return score
end

# define the GAN
function gan(z)
    # generate a synthetic sample using the generator
    synthetic_sample = generator(z)
    # pass the synthetic sample through the discriminator to get the score
    score = discriminator(synthetic_sample)
    return score
end

# define the loss function
function loss(score, real)
    # the loss function should encourage the score to be high for real samples and low for synthetic samples
    # for example, using binary cross entropy:
    if real
        return -log(score)
    else
        return -log(1 - score)
    end
end

# train the GAN
for (real_sample, synthetic_sample, real) in data
    # pass the real sample through the discriminator to get the score
    real_score = discriminator(real_sample)
    # pass the synthetic sample through the discriminator to get the score
    synthetic_score = discriminator(synthetic_sample)
    # compute the loss for the real sample
    real_loss = loss(real_score, true)
    # compute the loss for the synthetic sample
    synthetic_loss = loss(synthetic_score, false)
    # update the discriminator weights using gradient descent
    backpropagate(real_loss + synthetic_loss)
    
    # pass noise through the generator to get a synthetic sample
    synthetic_sample = generator(sample_noise())
    # pass the synthetic sample through the discriminator to get the score
    synthetic_score = discriminator(synthetic_sample)
    # compute the loss for the synthetic sample
    synthetic_loss = loss(synthetic_score, true)
    # update the generator weights using gradient descent
    backpropagate(synthetic_loss)
end


# This is just a rough example, and there are many details that have been left out (such as how to sample noise, how to implement the various layers of the network, etc.). However, this should give you an idea of how a GAN can be implemented in Julia.
