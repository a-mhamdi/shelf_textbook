# Loop through the number of iterations

    # Set a flag to indicate when the episode is done
    done = false

    # Loop until the episode is done
    while !done
        # Choose an action using the agent's policy
        action = agent.choose_action(state)

        # Take the action and observe the reward and next state
        reward, next_state, done = env.step(action)

        # Update the agent's policy using the reward and next state
        agent.update_policy(state, action, reward, next_state, discount_factor)

#= This pseudo-code shows the basic structure of a reinforcement learning algorithm, where an agent learns to interact with an environment in order to maximize a reward. The agent starts in an initial state, chooses an action based on its current policy, receives a reward and moves to a new state, and then updates its policy based on the reward and the new state. This process is repeated until the episode is done. =#
