#= VAE =#

# Here is a simple example of how a VAE could be implemented in Julia:

# define the encoder network
function encoder(x)
    # x is the input data
    # the encoder network should return the parameters of the latent distribution (mean and variance)
    # for example, using a fully connected network:
    h = relu(x * W1 + b1)
    mean = h * W2 + b2
    log_variance = h * W3 + b3
    return mean, log_variance
end

# define the decoder network
function decoder(z)
    # z is the latent representation
    # the decoder network should return the reconstruction of the input data
    # for example, using a fully connected network:
    h = relu(z * W4 + b4)
    reconstruction = h * W5 + b5
    return reconstruction
end

# define the VAE
function vae(x)
    # encode the data into the latent space
    mean, log_variance = encoder(x)
    # sample a latent representation from the latent distribution
    z = sample_latent(mean, log_variance)
    # decode the latent representation into a reconstruction of the input data
    reconstruction = decoder(z)
    return reconstruction
end

# define the loss function
function loss(x, reconstruction)
    # the reconstruction loss measures how well the VAE was able to reconstruct the input data
    reconstruction_loss = binary_crossentropy(x, reconstruction)
    # the KL divergence loss measures how close the latent distribution is to the prior distribution (usually a standard normal distribution)
    kl_loss = kl_divergence(mean, log_variance)
    # return the sum of the reconstruction loss and the KL divergence loss
    return reconstruction_loss + kl_loss
end

# train the VAE
for x in data
    # pass the input data through the VAE to get the reconstruction
    reconstruction = vae(x)
    # compute the loss
    l = loss(x, reconstruction)
    # update the network weights using gradient descent
    backpropagate(l)
end

# This is just a rough example, and there are many details that have been left out (such as how to sample from the latent distribution, how to implement the various layers of the network, etc.). However, this should give you an idea of how a VAE can be implemented in Julia.
